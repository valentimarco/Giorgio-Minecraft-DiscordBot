# giorgio-minecraft-discordbot

Some strange experiment with discord and minecraft...



## Dev
To start the bot you need to create the discord application, set the **Privileged Gateway Intents** and take the **Token**  under **bot settings**.
After that do the following:
1. `bun install`
2. `bunx prisma migrate dev`
3. `bun run dev`
